Pocket Money Calculator

A tool to help calculate how much pocket money is given/received, if the amount is determined by the age.

Assuming weekly pocket money of a set amount depending on age, you can specify a start (and end) date, see the total, and the breakdown per week. The day the pocket money is given is also taken into account.
